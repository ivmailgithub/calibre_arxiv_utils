pulled smarttitlefixer ... needs more tesing on a 80k book library it launches auto convert ... names look right but can't scan 10k books in the log and hour glasses 
calbire for hours...   gemini3 writes the job background ok for astroph so try that on smarttitlefixer so lots more testing .. raw files in the dev cycle
for claude and gemini are a lot of copy paste  .. i suppose i could do copilot-vscode...but the first copilot implenetation of dupfilefixer was full of
version bugs and just plain python syntax errors  .. hard to do a dev env because calibre classes have to be loaded...  so lots more testing to do  This is the 2nd
time i've had to delete the dir repo

arxivrename is now pulling epubs too and the mime type seems to be wrong .. the epub reader doesn't even detect zip .. trying html(experimental) plain html download in 
astroph which is working but i don't post web spiders...
